# Games Context

This is a repo which is the top level context for my game making efforts

## Repo organization

All game projects have their own directory in `/games/`

Game projects may be submodules so that they can have their own repo to be published to.

## Game Projects

Each game project will have a README.md file which describes the game and how to play it.

If the game has been published to itch.io the README.md file should contain a link to the game on itch.

## Technical Guidelines

For new games we're probably going to use: HTML5, Canvas, Typescript with a publication target of itch.io

No more than one backend server per game project.

Be sure to always judiciously add gitignore files
