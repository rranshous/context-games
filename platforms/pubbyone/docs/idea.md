# Idea

## Context

I'm creating a lot of html5 games. some of them use inferenace/AI/LLMs.

I want a set of tools for VSCode which the model can use to publish these so my friends can play them.

## Post Paradigm Shift

We are building everything in to the VSCode extension which presents the tools to the VSCode LLM and manages the server.

## Vision

I install the extension w/in my vscode and the model (copilot) can easily collaborate on publishing my games.
