# Game Platform Introduction

## Vision

Create a simple, self-hosted game platform similar to itch.io that enables publishing and playing HTML5 games with AI/ML inference capabilities. The platform addresses the gap where current game hosting platforms don't provide easy access to AI models from the frontend.

## Core Problem

- HTML5 games that need AI/ML inference have limited publishing options
- Current platforms (itch.io, etc.) don't provide model access from frontend
- No easy way for friends to play AI-powered games
- Publishing workflow for AI games is complex and fragmented

## Goals

### Phase 1: Personal Platform (Experimental)
- Publish Robby's HTML5 games (including AI-powered ones)
- Enable friends to easily discover and play games
- Seamless publishing workflow integrated with development process
- AI inference proxy for frontend game access
- Keep everything simple - this is exploratory work

### Phase 2: Community Platform (Future)
- User management and rate limiting
- Allow other developers to publish games
- Enhanced discovery and social features
- Performance optimizations (caching, etc.)

## Key Requirements

### Technical
- Host HTML5 games with proper sandboxing
- Backend proxy for AI inference (supporting standards like Ollama API)
- TypeScript everywhere possible for consistency
- Fast game loading and responsive gameplay
- Desktop-hosted backend (simple deployment)

### Workflow Integration
- CLI tools for publishing games
- Integration with VS Code/Copilot workflow
- Automated deployment from development
- Git integration (potential future enhancement)

### User Experience
- Simple game discovery interface
- No-friction game launching

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Platform
- [ ] Can publish and host HTML5 games
- [ ] Games can access AI inference APIs
- [ ] Friends can browse and play games
- [ ] Publishing integrated into development workflow

### Extended Success
- [ ] Multiple developers using platform
- [ ] Variety of AI-powered games hosted
- [ ] Community features (ratings, comments)
- [ ] Analytics and developer insights

## Technical Approach (Initial Thoughts)

### Architecture
- React frontend for game platform UI
- TypeScript backend (Node.js/Express) hosted on desktop
- AI inference proxy (separate concern from game hosting)
- Simple database for games and metadata

### AI Integration
- Backend proxy supporting standard APIs (Ollama, etc.)
- Frontend games use TypeScript libs through proxy
- Keep inference concerns separate from game hosting
- No initial focus on caching/rate limiting (experimental phase)

### Publishing Workflow
- CLI tool for game uploads
- Simple metadata management (descriptions, screenshots, etc.)
- Potential git integration for future exploration

## Next Steps

1. **Plan**: Design detailed architecture and workflows
2. **Prototype**: Build minimal platform for single game
3. **Iterate**: Add features based on usage and feedback
4. **Scale**: Expand to support multiple games and users
