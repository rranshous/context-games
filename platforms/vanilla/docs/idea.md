# Idea

Super strait forward, simple, expected platform for hosting html5 games

## Context

I am making HTML5 games and I want a simple, dumbly easy way to host them

This is for personal use.

## Tech guidance

I prefer Typescript.

Use libraries as much as possible.

Use libraries / frameworks and lean on REST.

I want to be able to make a client simply.

Super simple is best.

## Future

Extend the platform to support games using inference.
