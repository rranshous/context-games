# Vanilla Game Platform - Features

## Core Features

### Game Upload & Management
- ✅ **Single HTML File Upload** - Upload standalone HTML games
- ✅ **ZIP Archive Support** - Upload complete game projects with multiple files

- ✅ **Itch.io Compatibility** - Supports standard itch.io game packaging format
- ✅ **Game Metadata Tracking** - JSON-based metadata storage for all uploaded games
- ✅ **Upload Success/Error Messaging** - Real-time feedback on upload operations

### Game Serving & Playback
- ✅ **Direct Game Launching** - Click-to-play games in new browser tabs
- ✅ **Proper Module Support** - ES6 modules load correctly with proper MIME types
- ✅ **Static Asset Serving** - Images, audio, and other assets served correctly
- ✅ **Trailing Slash Redirects** - Ensures relative paths resolve correctly
- ✅ **Multi-file Game Support** - Games with dist/, src/, resources/ folders work

- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
- ✅ **Success Messages** - Visual feedback for successful uploads
- ✅ **No Games State** - Friendly message when no games are uploaded

### REST API
- ✅ `GET /api/games` - List all uploaded games
- ✅ `POST /api/games` - Upload a new game (multipart/form-data)
- ✅ `GET /api/games/:id` - Get specific game metadata
- ✅ `GET /games/:id/` - Play a game (serves index.html)
- ✅ `GET /games/:id/*` - Serve game assets with correct MIME types
- ✅ `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ **TypeScript Backend** - Type-safe Express server
- ✅ **File-Based Storage** - No database required, simple and reliable
- ✅ **Multer Integration** - Robust file upload handling
- ✅ **ADM-ZIP Integration** - ZIP extraction for game packages
- ✅ **CORS Enabled** - Cross-origin requests supported
- ✅ **Hot Reload Dev Mode** - tsx watch for development

### MIME Type Handling
- ✅ `.js` → `application/javascript`
- ✅ `.mjs` → `application/javascript`
- ✅ `.json` → `application/json`
- ✅ `.css` → `text/css`
- ✅ `.html` → `text/html`
- ✅ `.png` → `image/png`
- ✅ `.jpg/.jpeg` → `image/jpeg`
- ✅ `.gif` → `image/gif`
- ✅ `.svg` → `image/svg+xml`
- ✅ `.wasm` → `application/wasm`
- ✅ `.map` → `application/json`

## Tested Games

### Successfully Running
1. **Dark Hall** (v0.1.0)
   - TypeScript maze game with ES6 modules
   - Complex directory structure (dist/, src/, presentation/, simulation/)
   - Canvas-based 2D rendering
   - Status: ✅ Working perfectly

2. **Dinosaur Dance** (v1.0.0)
   - Voice-controlled painting canvas
   - Vite-built TypeScript game
   - Web Speech API integration
   - Status: ✅ Working perfectly

3. **Wallverine** (v1.0.0)
   - Voice-controlled wall animations
   - Vite-built TypeScript game
   - Complex particle effects
   - Status: ✅ Working perfectly

4. **Race On** (v1.0.0)
   - Combat racing game with pixel art
   - Large asset collection (resources/, dist/)
   - Status: ✅ Uploaded, minor asset path issue in game code

## Build Script Compatibility

The platform works with various build scripts:

### Supported Patterns
- ✅ `npm run build:itch` (darkhall style)
- ✅ `npm run publish` (dinosaur-dance, wallverine)
- ✅ TypeScript + Vite builds
- ✅ Custom bash build scripts

### Required ZIP Structure
```
game.zip/
├── index.html (required at root)
├── assets/
├── dist/
├── resources/
└── ... (any other files)
```

## Development Tools

### Browser Automation Testing
- ✅ **Playwright Integration** - Automated testing with browser tools
- ✅ **Upload Testing** - Automated file upload verification
- ✅ **Console Monitoring** - Automatic error detection
- ✅ **Screenshot Capture** - Visual verification of games

### npm Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Development mode with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm start` - Production mode

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Game deletion functionality
- [ ] Game editing/re-upload
- [ ] Categories and tags
- [ ] Search and filtering
- [ ] Game screenshots/thumbnails
- [ ] Play count tracking
- [ ] User authentication (optional)
- [ ] Game ratings/reviews
- [ ] AI inference integration for dynamic games
- [ ] Bulk upload support
- [ ] Game versioning

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Docker deployment
- [ ] Production-ready error handling
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] File size limits configuration
- [ ] Database option (optional, for scale)
- [ ] CDN integration for assets
- [ ] Backup/restore functionality

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Race On Asset Loading** - Game code uses relative paths that need adjustment
2. **No Game Deletion** - Can only add games, not remove them
3. **No Edit Functionality** - Cannot update existing games

### Limitations
- Single-user/personal use focus
- No authentication system
- Limited to file-based storage
- No game validation beyond ZIP structure

## Commits History

4. Complete documentation
5. ZIP file support for itch.io uploads
6. MIME type fixes for JavaScript modules
7. Trailing slash redirect for relative paths
8. Client-side trailing slash in URLs
9. Manual file serving with proper MIME types

## Performance

- **Upload Speed**: Dependent on file size and network
- **Game Load Time**: Fast (direct static file serving)
- **Concurrent Games**: Limited by Express default settings
- **Storage**: File-based, grows with number of games

## Security Considerations

- ZIP extraction safety checks (index.html required)
- File type validation (HTML/ZIP only)
- Temporary file cleanup after extraction
- No executable code validation (trust-based)
- CORS enabled (adjust for production)
