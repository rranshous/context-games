      "fileName": "game.html",
      "fileType": "text/html"

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Express.js** - Web server and REST API
- **Multer** - File upload handling
- **File-based storage** - No database required
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Simple client-side code

## Project Structure

```
platforms/vanilla/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server.ts          # Express server with REST API
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html         # Web interface
â”œâ”€â”€ games/                 # Uploaded games (created at runtime)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json      # Game metadata
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [game-id]/         # Individual game directories
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/               # Temporary upload directory
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Development

The platform uses TypeScript with hot-reloading in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This uses `tsx watch` to automatically restart the server when you make changes.

## Production Deployment

1. Build the TypeScript:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

Or use PM2 or similar for process management:
```bash
pm2 start dist/server.js --name vanilla-games
```

## Future Plans

- Support for zipped game projects with multiple files
- Game categories and tags
- Search and filtering
- Integration with AI inference for dynamic games
- User authentication (optional)
- Game analytics
