# Game Feel

## Target Audience

Primary: Family play - Robby, girlfriend, and 10-year-old stepson
- Robby & stepson: enjoy faster-paced games
- Girlfriend: prefers more accessible pace

The game needs to thread the needle - engaging for faster players, not overwhelming for others.

## Reference Games

### Space Gladiators (PRIMARY reference)
- By Blobfish (Brotato devs)
- Side-scroller with roguelite elements
- Same DNA as Dead Cells but more approachable
- Hand-drawn aesthetic, less "serious" feel
- Family liked this one

### Dead Cells (SECONDARY reference)
- Mechanics and structure inspiration
- **NOT** the hardcore pace or precision requirements
- Too fast/punishing for family play

### Brotato
- Item variety and build diversity inspiration
- Wave-based progression model
- Family plays this together on Xbox

## Core Feel Principles

### Accessible, Not Easy
- Forgiving timing windows
- Clear visual feedback
- Generous hitboxes (in player's favor)
- But still has challenge and skill expression

### Side-Scroller Platformer
- Horizontal movement with jumping
- Platforms, ledges, verticality
- NOT top-down arena (that's Brotato territory)

### Pace
- Medium pace - not twitchy, not sluggish
- Moments of intensity (forge defense) punctuated by exploration
- Player controls the pace somewhat via forge engagement

### Build Variety Over Execution
- Success comes from interesting ability combinations
- NOT from frame-perfect dodges
- The generated abilities ARE the skill expression

## Controls

Target: Keyboard (arrows/WASD + action keys)
Future: Xbox controller support (family plays on couch)

Keep it simple:
- Move (left/right)
- Jump
- Attack
- Interact (for forges)
- Maybe: dash/dodge (if it fits the pace)

## Difficulty Considerations

### Natural Scaling
- More forges = more abilities = more power, but also more risk during defense
- Player self-selects difficulty by forge engagement

### Avoid Frustration
- Generous checkpoints or short runs
- Death should feel "fair" not cheap
- Quick restart to try again

### Family Mode?
- Maybe: optional "chill mode" with reduced enemy aggression
- Or just tune the base difficulty to be accessible

## Open Questions

- Run length: 5 min? 15 min? 30 min?
- Progression structure: floors, rooms, or continuous scroll?
- Between-run persistence: none, unlocks, or meta-progression?
- Multiplayer: single-player first, but design for potential co-op?
