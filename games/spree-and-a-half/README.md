# Spree-and-a-Half

**Swarm-controlled sword game exploring collective behavior and emergent gameplay**

## Concept
Control a swarm of swords using keyboard and mouse input. Instead of managing a single character, you command an entire flock that moves, attacks, and responds as a collective entity.

## Status
ðŸŽ¯ **Status:** Initial concept and experimentation phase  
ðŸŽ® **Published:** Not yet  
ðŸ¤– **AI:** None planned initially  
âœ¨ **Unique:** Swarm control mechanics, collective sword behavior, experimental input schemes

## Vision
- **Collective Control:** Manage a swarm rather than individual units
- **Emergent Behavior:** Swords that exhibit flocking and coordinated movement
- **Experimental Controls:** Discover interesting ways to influence swarm behavior
- **Visual Impact:** Coordinated sword swarms creating satisfying visual patterns

## Assets Available
- Custom sword graphics for swarm entities
- NPC character art
- Background environmental assets
- Additional game elements

## Technical Approach
- **Architecture:** Simulation â†” Presentation â†” Input separation (Dark Hall pattern)
- **Tech Stack:** HTML5 Canvas + TypeScript + Vite
- **Core System:** Boids-based flocking with player influence layers

## Current Focus
Experimenting with control schemes and swarm dynamics to find the most engaging gameplay patterns.
