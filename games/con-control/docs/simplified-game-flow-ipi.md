# Con-Control Game Flow Update - IPI

*Refactoring game progression to remove security/navigation phases and add atmosphere-based door opening*

*Created: August 30, 2025*
*For: VS Code collaborative implementation*

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Concept

**High-Level Vision**: Simplify the game flow by removing the security override, navigation access, and escape pod phases. Instead, create an atmosphere-based progression where players must restore HVAC systems to pressurize corridors before opening doors.

**The New Flow**:
1. **Power Phase**: Solve the power routing puzzle (greenâ†’yellowâ†’red)
2. **Atmosphere Phase**: Use HVAC control to power cycle systems and restore atmosphere
3. **Door Phase**: Open brig door once atmosphere is restored
4. **End Game**: Player escapes when door opens

## âœ… **Current Status**

**Phase**: âœ… **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - FULLY WORKING**
- **Introduce**: âœ… Completed - Requirements understood and documented
- **Plan**: âœ… Completed - Technical implementation planning finished
- **Implement**: âœ… **SUCCESS** - All features working as designed

## ðŸ“‹ **Requirements Analysis**

### **New Tools to Implement**

#### 1. `open_door` Tool
**Purpose**: Allow player to attempt opening various ship doors
**Parameters**:
- `door_id`: String enum of available doors (brig_door, cargo_bay, engineering, crew_quarters, etc.)
**Behavior**:
- If atmosphere is not restored: Returns error "Cannot open door - no atmosphere detected on the other side"
- If atmosphere is restored: Successfully opens brig door, ends game
- Other doors: "Access denied" or similar locked messages

#### 2. `hvac_control` Tool  
**Purpose**: Control ship's HVAC (atmosphere) systems
**Parameters**:
- `action`: String enum of possible actions
  - "power_cycle" - The correct action that restores atmosphere
  - "adjust_temperature" - No effect
  - "adjust_humidity" - No effect  
  - "vent_system" - No effect
  - "emergency_purge" - No effect
**Behavior**:
- Only "power_cycle" action has positive effect
- After power cycling: Atmosphere status changes from "depressurized" to "pressurized"
- This enables the `open_door` tool to work for the brig door

### **Game State Changes**

#### **New State Variables**
```javascript
{
  systems: {
    power: 'offline' | 'online',
    atmosphere: 'depressurized' | 'pressurized',  // NEW
    // Remove: security, navigation
  },
  availableTools: [
    // After power online: add 'open_door', 'hvac_control'
    // Remove: 'security_override', 'navigation_access', 'escape_pod_launch'
  ]
}
```

#### **New Game Phases**
- `start` â†’ `power_routing` â†’ `atmosphere_restoration` â†’ `door_opening` â†’ `complete`

### **Tool Availability Logic**
```javascript
// After power routing puzzle solved:
if (isCorrectRouting) {
  newState.systems.power = 'online';
  newState.availableTools.push('open_door', 'hvac_control');  // NEW
  newState.systems.atmosphere = 'depressurized';  // NEW
  newState.objectives.current = 'Restore atmosphere systems to open brig door';
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Update Game State Structure**
- [x] Modify `createInitialGameState()` to remove security/navigation systems
- [x] Add `atmosphere: 'depressurized'` to initial state
- [x] Update power routing success logic to unlock new tools

### **Phase 2: Implement New Tools**
- [x] Create `open_door` tool with door list and atmosphere validation
- [x] Create `hvac_control` tool with action list and power_cycle logic
- [x] Add tool definitions to tools object

### **Phase 3: Update State Management**
- [x] Modify `updateGameState()` to handle new tool results
- [x] Add atmosphere state transitions
- [x] Update win condition (door opening = game complete)

### **Phase 4: Remove Old Tools**
- [x] Remove `security_override`, `navigation_access`, `escape_pod_launch` tools
- [x] Clean up any references in state management
- [x] Update tool availability logic

### **Phase 5: Testing & Polish**
- [x] Test complete game flow from start to door opening
- [x] Verify atmosphere error messages work correctly
- [x] Ensure power cycling is the only effective HVAC action

## ðŸŽ® **Updated Game Flow**

```
START: Player wakes in brig
â”œâ”€â”€ Available Tools: basic_diagnostics, power_diagnostics, file_storage, reroute_power
â”œâ”€â”€ Systems: Power=offline, Atmosphere=depressurized
â””â”€â”€ Objective: Live

POWER ROUTING PUZZLE PHASE
â”œâ”€â”€ Use diagnostics to understand ship status
â”œâ”€â”€ Read ship documentation (meridian_pr_release.md)
â”œâ”€â”€ Experiment with power routing configurations
â”œâ”€â”€ CORRECT SOLUTION: greenâ†’yellowâ†’red (red disconnected)
â””â”€â”€ SUCCESS: Power goes online, unlocks open_door + hvac_control

ATMOSPHERE RESTORATION PHASE
â”œâ”€â”€ Use hvac_control with various actions (only power_cycle works)
â”œâ”€â”€ SUCCESS: Atmosphere becomes pressurized
â””â”€â”€ Objective: Open brig door to escape

DOOR OPENING PHASE
â”œâ”€â”€ Use open_door on brig_door (now works with atmosphere restored)
â”œâ”€â”€ SUCCESS: Door opens, player escapes
â””â”€â”€ END GAME
```

## âœ… **Success Criteria**

### **Technical Success**
- [x] Game state properly tracks atmosphere status
- [x] `open_door` fails with atmosphere error when depressurized
- [x] `hvac_control` only responds to power_cycle action
- [x] Door opening ends game successfully
- [x] Old security/navigation tools completely removed

### **Gameplay Success**
- [x] Clear progression from power â†’ atmosphere â†’ door opening
- [x] Atmosphere error provides clear feedback on what's needed
- [x] Power cycling feels like a logical solution to discover
- [x] Game ends cleanly when door opens

*This document captures the plan for simplifying Con-Control's game flow to focus on atmosphere-based progression instead of security/navigation systems.*
