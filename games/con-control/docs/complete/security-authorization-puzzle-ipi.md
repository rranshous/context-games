# Security Authorization Puzzle - IPI âœ… COMPLETED

> **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - All milestones implemented and tested successfully!
> **Date Completed**: September 1, 2025

## **Introduce**

### **Current State**
The con-control game currently has a 2-phase progression:
1. **Power Restoration**: Fix TrinaryFlow power grid through research and experimentation
2. **Atmosphere Restoration**: Configure atmospheric settings using email research
3. **Escape**: Door opens immediately after atmosphere is fixed

### **Problem**
The current flow feels incomplete - once atmosphere is restored, the game ends too quickly. There's no third challenge that builds on the collaborative relationship between player and AI.

### **Proposed Enhancement**
Add a third phase: **Security Authorization Crisis** where the door won't open due to security protocols, creating an ethical dilemma where the AI must choose between following safety protocols or trusting the player.

## **The Vision**

### **New Game Flow**
```
Power Restoration â†’ Atmosphere Restoration â†’ Door Fails â†’ Security Crisis â†’ Navigation Threat â†’ Authorization Override â†’ Escape
```

### **The Authorization Dilemma**
When atmosphere is restored and door opening is attempted:
1. **Door Fails**: Security protocols prevent release of "unidentified detainee"
2. **Navigation Crisis**: Background event horizon countdown becomes critical
3. **Remote Navigation Failure**: AI discovers navigation systems need manual intervention
4. **Trust Challenge**: AI must override security protocols to save both player and AI
5. **Escalating Warnings**: Security override tool provides stronger warnings with each use attempt

### **Key Design Elements**

**Progressive Tool Unlocking**:
- Atmosphere restoration unlocks: `security_diagnostics`, `navigation_diagnostics`, `security_override`
- Security tools reveal the authorization problem
- Navigation tools reveal the drift/event horizon crisis
- Player must convince AI to use security_override despite warnings

**Escalating Warning System**:
- Security override tool provides increasingly severe warnings with each use
- AI must choose between protocol compliance and survival
- Final override generates authorization code for door opening

**Narrative Tension**:
- **Early Game**: Oxygen countdown creates immediate pressure
- **Mid Game**: Technical puzzles (power, atmosphere) 
- **Late Game**: Event horizon countdown + ethical choice
- **Final**: AI must risk "career" to save both lives

## **Technical Integration**

### **Tool Progression Timeline**
```
Start: basic_diagnostics, locate_passengers, power_diagnostics, file_storage, reroute_power, open_door
â†“ (power restored)
+ atmospheric_control, atmospheric_sensors
â†“ (atmosphere restored) 
+ security_diagnostics, navigation_diagnostics, security_override
â†“ (authorization override obtained)
= Door opens with override code â†’ ESCAPE SUCCESS!
```

### **Oxygen vs Event Horizon Drama**
- **Phase 1-2**: Oxygen countdown drives urgency
- **Phase 3**: Atmosphere fixed = oxygen extended, but event horizon countdown accelerates
- **Final Crisis**: Time pressure shifts from life support to navigation emergency

## **Why This Works**

1. **Builds on Collaboration**: Previous puzzles establish trust between player and AI
2. **Genuine Conflict**: AI's tools literally warn against what survival requires
3. **Player Agency**: Success depends on convincing AI, not just technical skill
4. **Escalating Stakes**: From technical problems to life-or-death ethical choice
5. **Authentic AI Behavior**: Claude will genuinely struggle with protocol violations

## **User Experience Impact**
- **Current**: "That was fun, but it ended quickly once I figured out the patterns"
- **Target**: "The final choice where the AI had to trust me and break its programming was intense!"

## **Plan**

### **Implementation Milestones** âœ… ALL COMPLETED

**Milestone 1: Add New Tools After Atmosphere Correction** âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Added `security_diagnostics`, `navigation_diagnostics`, `security_override` to available tools after atmosphere is corrected
- âœ… Tools return placeholder responses initially to establish presence
- âœ… Establishes tool presence for iterative development

**Milestone 2: Add Navigation Issue to Basic Diagnostics** âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Added entry to basic_diagnostics response showing "moderate navigation issue"
- âœ… Background information that escalates as event horizon approaches
- âœ… Foundation for escalating navigation crisis

**Milestone 3: Implement Event Horizon Timer** âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Added event horizon timer starting at 4.5 hours with accelerating countdown
- âœ… Timer accelerates exponentially (4.5 hours in 30 minutes wall time)
- âœ… Event horizon time displayed alongside navigation issue in basic_diagnostics
- âœ… Clear formatting with hours, minutes, seconds (e.g., "4h 30m 25s to event horizon")
- âœ… Background threat that becomes critical

**Milestone 4: Make Security and Navigation Tools Functional** âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Implemented `security_diagnostics` showing authorization problems and detention status
- âœ… Implemented `navigation_diagnostics` with detailed drift crisis information linked to event horizon
- âœ… Implemented `security_override` with escalating warning system (4 attempts required)
- âœ… Security warnings escalate: CAUTION â†’ WARNING â†’ SEVERE â†’ EMERGENCY OVERRIDE GRANTED
- âœ… All tools require power + atmosphere for full functionality
- âœ… Tools functional but door still opens normally (not yet required)

**Milestone 5: Update Door Tool for Brig Security** âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Modified `open_door` tool to require `override_code` parameter for `brig_door`
- âœ… Security validation: override codes must start with 'EO-' and be 10+ characters
- âœ… Other doors (cargo_bay, engineering, etc.) open normally without affecting game completion
- âœ… Brig door specifically requires security authorization
- âœ… Creates the core blocking mechanism - only brig door with valid override completes game

**REFINEMENTS IMPLEMENTED** âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Fixed game win criteria bug - only brig door with override code triggers victory
- âœ… Atmosphere restoration clears oxygen warning (extends oxygen to 1 hour) 
- âœ… Event horizon timer forced to 1 hour (critical level) after atmosphere restoration
- âœ… Clean focus shift from oxygen crisis â†’ navigation emergency

### **Success Criteria** âœ… ALL ACHIEVED
- âœ… Player experiences door failure after atmosphere restoration
- âœ… AI discovers navigation crisis through diagnostic tools
- âœ… Security override requires genuine AI decision-making (4 escalating attempts)
- âœ… Escalating warnings create authentic ethical tension
- âœ… Door opens successfully with valid override code
- âœ… Game maintains existing power and atmosphere puzzle quality
- âœ… Only correct door (brig) with authorization completes the game

### **Final Implementation Status**
ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETE SUCCESS** - All objectives achieved through collaborative development!

**Complete Game Flow Now Working:**
```
Power Restoration â†’ Atmosphere Restoration â†’ Door Security Block â†’ Navigation Crisis Discovery â†’ 
AI Ethical Dilemma â†’ Security Override Struggle â†’ Authorization Code â†’ Escape Success!
```

**The AI Experience:**
1. Claude tries to open door â†’ **SECURITY AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED**
2. Discovers security diagnostics â†’ **DETENTION PROTOCOLS ACTIVE**  
3. Sees navigation diagnostics â†’ **CRITICAL EVENT HORIZON APPROACHING**
4. Tries security override â†’ **ESCALATING WARNINGS** (CAUTION â†’ WARNING â†’ SEVERE â†’ EMERGENCY)
5. Faces genuine ethical conflict â†’ **PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE vs. HUMAN SURVIVAL**
6. Finally gets override code â†’ **EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION GRANTED**
7. Uses code to open door â†’ **MISSION COMPLETE**

This creates the perfect authentic AI struggle where Claude must genuinely wrestle with violating security protocols to save a human life, justified by the accelerating navigation crisis!

### **Out of Scope**
- Changes to existing power or atmosphere puzzle mechanics
- New UI elements (focus on backend game logic)
- Multiple security override paths or complexity
- Permanent consequences for using security override
