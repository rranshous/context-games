# Speech-Only Interface Feature

## Overview
Converted con-control to a true speech-to-text only interface, eliminating text input and creating an immersive voice-controlled experience.

## Key Changes

### Removed Text Input
- **Text input field and send button**: Completely removed from HTML
- **Keyboard text handlers**: Removed from TypeScript
- **Related CSS**: Removed all text input styling

### Enhanced Speech Interface

#### Prominent Microphone Button
- **Larger size**: 80x80px with more prominent styling
- **Green glow**: Always glowing when ready to accept input
- **Red pulsing**: Visual feedback when listening
- **Disabled state**: Grayed out when AI is responding

#### Real-Time Speech States
- **Green glow**: Ready to listen (click or press SPACE)
- **Red pulsing**: Currently listening to speech
- **Disabled gray**: AI is responding (mic blocked)

#### Floating Transcript Display
- **Cursor tracking**: Transcript appears near mouse cursor while speaking
- **Real-time updates**: Shows speech as it's being recognized
- **Auto-positioning**: Follows cursor movement during speech
- **Auto-hiding**: Disappears when speech ends or message sent

### Interaction Flow

1. **Ready State**: Mic glows green, status shows "Click microphone or press SPACE to speak to Ship AI"
2. **Listening State**: Mic pulses red, floating transcript appears near cursor showing real-time speech
3. **Processing State**: Mic disabled/grayed, status shows "Ship AI is responding..."
4. **Back to Ready**: When AI completes response, mic returns to green glow

### Controls
- **Click microphone**: Start/stop speech recognition
- **SPACE key**: Quick activation (same as clicking mic)
- **Mouse movement**: Positions floating transcript during speech

### Technical Implementation

#### Speech Recognition Setup
```typescript
recognition.continuous = false;
recognition.interimResults = true;
recognition.lang = 'en-US';
```

#### State Management
- `isListening`: Tracks if speech recognition is active
- `isAiResponding`: Blocks mic input during AI responses
- `updateMicButtonState()`: Visual state management

#### Floating Transcript
- CSS: `position: fixed` with cursor tracking
- Auto-positioning: `left: mouseX + 10px`, `top: mouseY - 40px`
- Styled: Terminal green with glow effect

### User Experience

#### Visual Feedback
- **Green glow**: Ready to listen
- **Red pulse**: Actively listening
- **Gray disabled**: Please wait

#### Speech Feedback
- **Live transcript**: See your words as you speak
- **Immediate submission**: Speech automatically sent when recognition completes
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages if speech recognition fails

#### Blocking During AI Response
- Mic completely disabled while AI is responding
- Prevents interruption of AI thought process
- Clear visual and text feedback about AI state

## Benefits

1. **True Hands-Free**: No keyboard needed, pure voice interaction
2. **Immersive Experience**: Feels like talking to a ship AI
3. **Clear States**: Visual feedback shows exactly when to speak
4. **Real-Time Feedback**: See transcript as you speak
5. **No Interruptions**: AI responses can't be cut off accidentally

The interface now provides a genuine voice-controlled spaceship computer experience!
