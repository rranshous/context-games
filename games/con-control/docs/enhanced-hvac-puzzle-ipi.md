# Enhanced HVAC Puzzle System - IPI

## **Introduce**

### **Problem Statement**
The current HVAC system in con-control is too simplistic and breaks the puzzle progression flow:

1. **Single Action Solution**: AI just calls `hvac_control` with `power_cycle` ‚Üí instant success
2. **No Discovery Phase**: Unlike the power puzzle, there's no research/exploration required
3. **Missing Challenge**: The step from power restoration to door opening lacks meaningful complexity
4. **Breaks Pattern**: Power puzzle has Discovery‚ÜíResearch‚ÜíExperimentation‚ÜíSolution, HVAC doesn't

### **Current HVAC Flow**
```
Power Online ‚Üí hvac_control tool unlocks ‚Üí AI calls power_cycle ‚Üí Done
```

### **Target HVAC Flow** 
```
Power Online ‚Üí atmospheric_sensors unlocks ‚Üí Discovery: Hull breaches found
            ‚Üì
Research: Read AtmosphereGuardian manual ‚Üí Learn breach repair procedures  
            ‚Üì
Experimentation: Try different repair sequences ‚Üí Some fail, some work
            ‚Üì
Solution: Correct breach repair order + atmospheric rebalancing ‚Üí Success
```

### **Design Goals**
- **Maintain Discovery Pattern**: AI must explore and research to understand the problem
- **Multi-Stage Complexity**: Multiple tools and steps required, not single action
- **Failure States**: Wrong sequences should have consequences (like power feedback loops)
- **Research Rewards**: Reading documentation should provide critical information
- **Linear Progression**: Clear power‚ÜíHVAC‚Üídoor dependency chain

### **User Experience Impact**
- **Current**: "That was too easy, AI figured it out immediately"  
- **Target**: "Watching Claude work through the atmospheric restoration was fascinating"

## **Scope & Constraints**

### **In Scope**
- New atmospheric diagnostic tools
- Multi-stage hull breach repair system
- Enhanced atmospheric rebalancing procedures
- New ship documentation for AtmosphereGuardian 3000‚Ñ¢
- Failure states and safety lockouts
- Integration with existing power‚Üídoor progression

### **Out of Scope** 
- Changes to power puzzle system (working well)
- Door opening mechanics (working well)
- UI/UX changes (focus on backend puzzle logic)
- New ship systems beyond atmospheric

### **Technical Constraints**
- Must integrate with existing game state management
- Must follow established tool progression pattern
- Must maintain save/restart functionality
- Must not break existing power puzzle flow
