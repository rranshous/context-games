# A game where magic can be mapped and understood via biology

## Initial idea
See [Magical DNA System](magical_dna_system.md) for full details

## Where to start
I want to start off by focusing on the magic simulator.

## Technical Guidance
I want it in typescript.

## Impl consideration
I want the magic simulator to be a standalone module that can be imported into the game engine.

I want the magic simulator to have extensive tests. I want to be sure the magic simulator is working well.

Later we'll add more complexity to the magic simulator and I want to be sure it stays internally consistant as it grows.
