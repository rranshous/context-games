- [Dark Hall](./darkhall/) - Horror maze game with procedural generation and advanced lighting system. Navigate dark corridors with only your flashlight while avoiding a monster with glowing red eyes. **Status:** âœ… Published on itch.io. **AI:** None. **Unique:** Triple-layer lighting system, line-of-sight rendering, footprint navigation trails.
- [Sparkly-Sim](./sparkly-sim/) - Ecosystem simulation where autonomous "Sparklings" explore varied landscapes, collect resources, and use AI-powered reasoning to adapt their behavior parameters. **Status:** Active development. **AI:** âœ… Anthropic Claude API for neural energy reasoning. **Unique:** AI-driven behavioral adaptation, emergent territorial behaviors, competition systems.
- [Diplomatic Waters](./diplomatic-waters/) - Treaty writing simulator where players draft agreements between nations during a water crisis. AI analyzes legal language for loopholes and simulates national responses. **Status:** Core features complete. **AI:** âœ… Claude AI for treaty analysis. **Unique:** Real treaty language analysis, dynamic diplomatic correspondence, legal ambiguity detection.
- [World Weaver](./world-weaver/) - Platform that helps children digitize hand-drawn characters and stories, transforming them into shareable wiki pages through webcam capture and voice descriptions. **Status:** âœ… MVP Complete. **AI:** âœ… Whisper (speech-to-text) + Ollama (content generation). **Unique:** Physical-to-digital transformation workflow, voice-driven character documentation, AI-assisted wiki generation.
- [Wallverine](./wallverine/) - Voice-controlled wall animation system that transforms any projector setup into an interactive art installation. Create layered visual compositions through spoken commands. **Status:** âœ… Published on itch.io. **AI:** None (uses Web Speech API). **Unique:** Browser-based projection system, voice-controlled layered effects, sophisticated depth and blending for wall-scale installations.
- [Stacksonstacks](./stacksonstacks/) - Game creation system currently featuring interactive creature simulations and point-and-click building tools. Building toward voice-driven AI collaborative creation where natural language becomes the primary interface. **Status:** âœ… Published on itch.io. **AI:** ðŸŽ¯ Planned (voice-driven AI collaboration). **Unique:** DOM-based architecture, snapshot save/load system, win conditions and collision detection. Future: voice commands for instant creation.
- [Dinosaur Dance](./dinosaur-dance/) - Voice-controlled collaborative art creation where you sing to create formations of dancing creatures. Represents early exploration of voice-controlled game interfaces. **Status:** âœ… Published on itch.io. **AI:** None (uses Web Speech API). **Unique:** Natural voice commands ("dance party", "clear dance floor"), organic creature set evolution through themes, musical intensity scaling with repeated commands.
- [All-Around-You](./all-around-you/) - Experimental 2D game where agents are implemented as WASM modules. Early exploration of modular agent architectures. **Status:** ðŸ§ª Early Prototype. **AI:** None. **Unique:** WASM-based agent system, modular entity architecture.
- [AI Orchestration Game](./ai-orchestration-game/) - Satirical workplace simulation where humans act as "middleware" between specialized AI agents, managing software development projects while dealing with an impatient boss. **Status:** ðŸ”„ Active Development. **AI:** âœ… Multiple AI agents (Product Vision, Code Writer, Verification). **Unique:** Human-as-middleware gameplay loop, dynamic boss interaction system, byzantine workflow processes that mirror real enterprise software development.
- [Sacred Scribe](./hard-find-metatrial/sacred-scribe/) - Text-based game where you play as a copywriter creating recruitment materials for a cult. AI analyzes writing effectiveness and personality type persuasion. **Status:** ðŸ§ª Early Development. **AI:** ðŸŽ¯ Planned (text analysis for recruitment effectiveness). **Unique:** Open-ended copywriting gameplay, psychological analysis of persuasion techniques, ethical decision-making through writing.
