# RitSim: Magic Mechanics & World Lore

*The fundamental laws governing ritual magic within the RitSim universe*

## üåü Overview

RitSim operates on the principle of **Sympathetic Resonance Magic** - a system where physical arrangements of sacred objects create energetic patterns that influence reality through symbolic correspondence.

## üïØÔ∏è Sacred Objects & Their Properties

### Candles (Elemental Conduits)
Each candle color channels a specific elemental force and emotional resonance:

- **Red Candles**: Element of Fire

  - Best for: Divination, healing rituals, emotional balance

- **Purple Candles**: Element of Spirit
  - Governs: Psychic power, mysticism, transformation, higher consciousness
  - Resonance: Spiritual elevation, magical amplification, connection to the divine
  - Best for: Advanced magic, spiritual growth, psychic enhancement

- **White Candles**: Element of Air
  - Governs: Purity, new beginnings, clarity, peace, protection
  - Resonance: Cleansing energy, fresh starts, divine blessing
  - Best for: Purification, blessing rituals, general magic amplification

### Stones (Earthly Anchors)
Crystalline structures that ground and focus magical energies:

- **Obsidian**: The Shadow Mirror
  - Properties: Protection, grounding, banishing negativity
  - Effect: Creates magical barriers, reflects harmful energy back to source
  - Placement: Best at cardinal points or as central anchor

- **Quartz**: The Universal Amplifier
  - Properties: Energy amplification, clarity, healing
  - Effect: Magnifies the power of nearby objects, purifies intentions
  - Placement: Central positions maximize amplification effect

- **Amethyst**: The Spiritual Gateway
  - Properties: Psychic enhancement, spiritual protection, wisdom
  - Effect: Opens pathways to higher consciousness, enhances intuition
  - Placement: Near the practitioner for personal enhancement

### Incense (Sacred Smoke)
Aromatic offerings that carry intentions to the spiritual realm:

- **Properties**: Communication bridge between physical and spiritual planes
- **Effect**: Carries prayers and intentions upward, creates sacred space
- **Placement**: Multiple sticks create stronger spiritual connection
- **Flow**: Smoke direction indicates spiritual approval or resistance

## üîÆ Ritual Mechanics

### Spatial Relationships
The positioning of objects creates geometric patterns that influence magical flow:

- **Center**: Objects placed centrally anchor the entire working
- **Cardinal Directions**: North (Earth), East (Air), South (Fire), West (Water)
- **Circles**: Protective and containing energy patterns
- **Lines**: Direct energy flow between points
- **Triangles**: Manifestation and transformation patterns

### Elemental Balance
Successful rituals often require elemental harmony:

- **Single Element**: Focused but potentially unstable
- **Opposing Pairs**: Fire/Water or Earth/Air create dynamic tension
- **Triads**: Three elements create stable but incomplete patterns  
- **Quaternary**: All four elements create perfect balance and maximum power

### Sympathetic Correspondences
Objects placed near each other create magical resonance:

- **Like attracts Like**: Similar colors/elements reinforce each other
- **Opposites create Tension**: Conflicting elements generate transformative energy
- **Sacred Geometry**: Patterns create predictable magical effects

## ‚ö° Magical Outcomes

### Success Indicators
- Harmonic element combinations
- Geometrically pleasing arrangements
- Balanced distribution of object types
- Clear intentional patterns

### Power Levels
- **Minimal**: Single objects or chaotic arrangements
- **Moderate**: Paired elements or simple patterns
- **Strong**: Balanced triads or clear geometric forms
- **Exceptional**: Perfect quaternary balance with sacred geometry

### Potential Effects
- **Manifestation**: Bringing desires into reality
- **Protection**: Creating barriers against harm
- **Healing**: Restoring balance and vitality
- **Divination**: Gaining insight into hidden knowledge
- **Transformation**: Changing fundamental aspects of reality

## üåô Mystical Interpretations

When analyzing a ritual arrangement, consider:

1. **Dominant Elements**: Which elemental forces are strongest?
2. **Geometric Patterns**: What sacred shapes emerge from the layout?
3. **Energy Flow**: How do the objects channel and direct power?
4. **Symbolic Meaning**: What story does the arrangement tell?
5. **Harmonic Resonance**: Do the components work together or conflict?

The effectiveness of any ritual depends not just on the objects used, but on the **intention behind their placement** and the **harmony achieved between conflicting forces**.

Broken or nonsense rituals may blow up, melt down tear reality, do nothing and everything in between.

Sloppy Rituals may result in sub par or underwhelming outcomes
