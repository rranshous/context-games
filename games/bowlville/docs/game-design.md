# Bowlville Game Design Document

## Initial Setup - Phase 1

### Completed:
- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ TypeScript + Vite configuration
- ✅ Basic HTML5 Canvas setup
- ✅ Initial game loop implementation
- ✅ Basic bowling lane rendering

### Current State:
- Basic game framework in place
- Simple canvas rendering with bowling lane visual
- Click event handling ready
- Game loop running

## Next Steps - Phase 2 Planning

### Game Mechanics to Implement:
1. **Bowling Ball Physics**
   - Ball rolling simulation
   - Collision detection with pins
   - Realistic physics movement

2. **Pin Setup**
   - Standard 10-pin arrangement
   - Pin physics and collision
   - Score calculation

3. **Player Interaction**
   - Ball throwing mechanics
   - Aim/power controls
   - Frame progression

### Technical Considerations:
- Physics engine needs (simple vs library)
- Sprite vs geometric rendering
- Game state management
- Score tracking system
